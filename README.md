# NES Emulator

## Installation
### Windows
Cloning this repo and running cmake should be enough on windows

### Linux / MacOS
#### Requirements
* SDL2
* SDL_ttf
* freetype6
* libpng
* zlib

I'll probably handle this better in the future, but for now install all of those manually.
Then set the appropriate CMake flags to the according library files._
